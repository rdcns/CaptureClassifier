# Capture Classifier
Python Automation Project

### The problem:
When I take a screenshot, it gets saved into a general folder called Screenshots automatically. After a time it gets to be a mess, you can't find anything you are looking for!
You can go back to the Screenshots and organize it time to time. But this is where I saw the opportunity.

What I want to accomplish with this personal project is to organize my photos, right on the spot! And allow myself the headspace to not worry about where I saved a screenshot when I need it later.

### How It Works?

When you take a screenshot using Snipping Tools, you can choose which file you want to save. No more scattered screenshots on my computer ! Woo !
